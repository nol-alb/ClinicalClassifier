# Deep Learning Models for Identification of Key Medical Classifier Terms from EHR related to Cardiology [Numen Health Internship]

## OVERVIEW
An internship task for the team of Niraj Anil, Noel Alben, Sai Deepika, and J Sumanth to train and test various deep learning models for the identification and extraction of key medical terms from electronic health records (EHRâ€™s) related to Cardiology, to be later used as a feature in the mobile application.

## GOALS ACHEIVED
1. Find and implement methods to extract medical terms and classifiers from SNOMED CT for purposes of identifying Key Medical Classifier terms from free text.
1. Search for additional databases for terms related to cardiology, specifically discharge summaries and Electronic Health Records.
1. Find, Test, and Train various Deep learning Models for key Medical term identification and extraction from free text Electronic Health Records [Named Entity Recognition].

## Repository Content and Instructions
1. The models in this repository are designed and altered using python script and most of the training of the models took place on local systems which brought about testing efficiency between 90-95%. 
2. Some important terms: **Natural Language Processing**, **SNOMED CT**, **Named Entity Recognition**, **Clinical Term Identification**, **BERT**
