# Deep Learning Models for Identification of Key Medical Classifier Terms from EHR related to Cardiology

This directory contains example code and trained datasets for Clinical Named Entity recognition using:
1. CliNER
2. MedTextClassification 
3. SpaCy
4. Word2Vec

Additionally this task was implemented using open source resources available on repositories linked below:<br>
### 1. BIOBERT: <br>
<p>
BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a recent paper [11] published by researchers at Google AI Language. It has caused a stir in the Machine Learning community by presenting state-of-the-art results in a wide variety of NLP tasks, including Question Answering (SQuAD v1.1), Natural Language Inference (MNLI), and others. <br>
BioBERT is a biomedical language representation model designed for biomedical text mining tasks such as biomedical named entity recognition, relation extraction, question answering, etc [12]. This project was undertaken by the engineers over at DMIS-Lab and they have provided weighted models trained over PubMed datasets which we can then exploit and tweak for our purposes. <br>
